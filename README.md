This is my progress through Jacob Seidelin's book "HTML5 Games: Creating Fun with HTML5, CSS3, and WebGL"

it's a pretty neat book.

so far theres a board with sprites that you can click to swap jewels around, the matched jewels are deleted,
existing jewels are shifted down, and new jewels are populated at the top.

it is meant to adjust to mobile devices, it utilizes a web worker for desktops, and some pretty neat OOJS
concepts. 


up next: 

keeping track of a players score, adding node.js, and moar that I dont know about yet!
